# AWS S3

## Buckets
- Buckets are containers for **object** (analogous to files). Buckets are the top-level containers for objects in S3.
- Buckets are created in a specific AWS region.
- Bucket names must be **globally unique**. Most other names in AWS (e.g., IAM users) only need to be regionally unique.
- Buckets can hold an unlimited number of objects (infinitely scalable).

### Specifics
- 3-63 character length for bucket names. Must start with a lowercase letter or number.
- Can't be IP formatted
- **100 buckets soft limit** in an AWS account. You can exceed it with a request to AWS support.
- **1000 buckets hard limit** in an AWS account.

### Objects 
Objects are the files stored in S3.
- The **key** is the unique identifiers for each object in a S3 bucket.
- The **value** is the object's binary data. The value can range from **0B to 5TB** (*exam point*)

### Blast Radius
Bucket data stays within its region unless you allow it to leave the region.

### Bucket Structure
Buckets are flat structures; it is not a file system. All objects are stored at the same level.
- S3 does not use a folder structure, but it **visually** emulates one if `/` characters are used in the object key (e.g., `/old/koala1.png`)

### Hardware
- S3 is an object store. Not a file store or block store.
- It is not a file store (e.g., no folder structure)
- It is not a block store (virtual hard disk) and cannot be mounted as a mount point or volume. Block storage is limited to one user accessing it at a time; S3 does not have this limitation.

### Architecture Choices
S3 should be the default choice for offloading data transfer and access.


## Resource Policies
S3 is private by default.
- S3 **bucket policies** are **resource policies** that govern access.
- Resource policies can allow/deny multiple accounts. 
- Resource policies can allow/deny access to anonymous accounts.
- Resource policies include a `Principal` property in their JSON. It is a distinguishing feature between Resource Policies and Identity Policies, which do not need a Principal because they are applied to the relevant Principal (IAM user, IAM group, IAM role, etc.).
- In contrast, Identity Policies can only be attached to an identity in the account. They cannot allow/deny access to other accounts or anonymous accounts.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}

```

### Conditions
Bucket policies can be configued with conditions to further restrict access, such as the IP address of the requester. MFA can also be required.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
ACLs are a legacy method for managing access to S3 resources. ACLs function on objects and buckets. ACLs are not recommended because they are inflexible and only support simple policies. They do not support conditions like bucket policies.

|Permission|Bucket|Object|
|---|---|---|
|Read|Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket|Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata|
|Write|Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete objects in the bucket|Not applicable|
|Read-ACP|Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL|Allows grantee to read the object ACL|
|Write-ACP|Allows grantee to write the bucket ACL|Allows grantee to write the object ACL|
|Full Control|Allows grantee to READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP on the bucket|Allows grantee to READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP on the object|

## Block Public Access
Block Public Access is a feature that helps prevent public access to S3 buckets; it was introduced to mitigate incorrect ACL configurations. 

Block Public Access is enabled by default for all new S3 buckets and covers the following:
- Block public access to buckets and objects granted through *new* ACLs
- Block public access to bucket and objects granted through *any* ACLs
- Block public access to bucket and objects granted through *new* bucket policies or access point policies
- Block public access to bucket and objects granted through *any* bucket policies or access point policies

## Permissions Policies
Buckets and objects can be configured via (1) identity policies, (2) resource policies, or (3) ACLs.
- Identity policies are useful for managing different resources, if there is a preference for IAM, or if the policy applies to a single account.
- Bucket policies are useful if managing only S3 or for allowing anonymous or cross-account access.
- ACLs generally should not be used.

## Static Website Hosting
- When creating a new bucket, the bucket policy must allow public read access. This setting technically *allows* you to configure public access to the bucket, but it does not make the contents public itself.
- The bucket policy, under properties -> bucket policy, must then be updated to explicitly allow public read access.
- Static website hosting must be enabled under properties -> static website hosting.

## S3 Versioning

- If versioning is enabled and an object is deleted in non-version-view mode, the object is not deleted. Instead, it is marked as deleted. Deleting the marker fully restores the object.
- If versioning is enabled and an object is deleted in version-view mode, the object is permanently deleted.

## Operations

## PUT (Upload)
S3 objects can be uploaded using either (1) single stream upload or (2) multipart upload. Multipart upload is strongly recommended to avoid failed uploads from disruptions.

- Objects must be smaller than 5GB.
- Multipart upload requires objects to be at least 100MB.
- Maximum number of parts is 10,000.
- Multipart part sizes must be between 5MB and 5GB. 

### S3 Transfer Acceleration
Uploading data to S3 can be slow when the data source is far away from the S3 bucket; public internet routing can be suboptimal. S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature that speeds up the transfer of files over long distances by using AWS's global network of edge locations to optimize routing.

- Transfer Acceleration is disabled by default. Enabling it has two requirements:
    - Bucket name must be DNS compatible.
    - Bucket name cannot contain periods.
